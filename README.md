# COVID-19 Transfer Learning Model
Application of Transfer Learning for detection of the COVID-19 disease.

The project is based on the [CheXNet model](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/chexnet/) proposed by the Standford ML Group and makes use of the Pytorch implementation found [here](https://github.com/jrzech/reproduce-chexnet) by John Zech.
